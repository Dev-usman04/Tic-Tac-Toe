React Tic-Tac-Toe with Socket.io:
This project is a real-time, multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React for the frontend and Node.js/Express with Socket.io for the backend. Players can join a game room, play against each other live, and interact with taunts. The backend manages game state, player turns, win/stalemate detection, and real-time communication between clients. The frontend provides a responsive, interactive UI for gameplay, status updates, and player interactions. The app demonstrates full-stack development with real-time web technologies and a clean, modern React interface.
